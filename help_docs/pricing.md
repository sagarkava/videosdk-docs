  - No, Free 10000 mins includes only call/conference; composer services like cloud recording, re-streaming (RTMP-out), and recorded video hosting are not included.

## **Calculation method**

#### **1. Does the Video SDK charge separately for Audio?**
  - No, Audio cost is already included in video cost. Although, audio conferencing cost ($0.0006/Audio min) applies only when there’s ONLY AUDIO conference going on.
  - In other words, if no one in the video conference has their camera ON, then it will be considered as Audio conference & $0.0006/Audio min would be charged.
#### **2. Please explain pricing calculation with an example**
  - It’s easy, let’s say 5 people have joined a meeting for half an hour. Here, 30 minutes is a meeting minutes.
      - Participant minutes = 30 meeting minutes x 5 participants
            
          = 150 participant minutes used
            
      - Considering $0.003/participant-min (HD Resolution)
            
          Total cost = 150 participant mins x $0.003
            
          = $0.45
            
#### **3. If I am using less than 10000 mins every month & not using add-on services (cloud recording, re-streaming, etc.), then will the Video SDK be free for me?**
  - Technically.. YES, in such a case the Video SDK would be free for you.
#### **4. If I have used, total of 25000 mins, among which 7000 audio mins, 8000 SD mins & 10000 HD mins, then which mins will be counted as free mins?**
  - Free 10000 mins are exhausted as per below sequence
        
    i. Audio mins
  
    ii. SD Video mins
  
    iii. HD Video mins
  
    iv. Full HD Video mins
  
    v. 2K Video mins
  
    vi. 2K+ Video mins
       
  - in your case, first 7000 audio mins would be considered FREE & then 3000 SD mins
  - Hence, you will be invoiced for 5000 SD mins & 10000 HD mins.
#### **5. I have used only 4000 mins this month, will the remaining free mins (6000 mins) be carried forward to next month?**
  - No. The remaining free mins will be cleared at the end of each calendar month
#### **6. I have usage more than 100K mins per month & my invoice size is larger. How to reduce it?**
  - It’s really justified to reduce your costs at volume usage. If your monthly usage is more than 100K mins per month, please contact sales on [https://videosdk.live/contact](https://videosdk.live/contact) or write on support@videosdk.live
#### **7. I have set the maxResolution to be (320 x 180) only, then why am I charged for HD video?**
  - You would be using either SD, HD, Full HD, 2K or 2K+, by aggregate resolution.
  - Aggregate resolution means a sum resolution of all video-streams, a user is watching at a time.
  - If a user is watching 8 video-streams of (320 x 180) then he is consuming [(360 x 180) x 8 video = 4,60,800px] hence he will be charged for HD resolution min.
#### **8. How do you calculate the aggregate video resolution?**
  - It’s an aggregated resolution, the end-user is downloading/viewing. You can check the table below for reference.
        
        
    | Videos on-screen* | Aggregated resolution | Price, per user per minute |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | 0 | Only audio | $0.0006 |
    | 1-2 | SD | $0.002 |
    | 3-5 | HD | $0.003 |
    | 6-10 | Full HD | $0.007 |
    | 11-17 | 2K | $0.007 |
    | 18+ | 2K+ | $0.007 |
    - Considering SD (640 x 360) resolution (16:9) per video, and one local user (self) video.
#### **9. In detail, how do you calculate the aggregate video resolution?**
  - As described above, it’s an aggregate resolution, the end-user is downloading/viewing. We are following below standard resolution to calculate your usage.
        
        
    | Video type | Aggregate resolution (px) | 16:9 Aspect ratio |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | SD | <= 2,30,400px | 360p: 640 x 360 |
    | HD | 2,30,401px to 9,21,600px | 720p: 1280 × 720 |
    | Full HD | 9,21,601px to 20,73,600px | 1080p: 1920 x 1080 |
    | 2K | 20,73,601px to 36,86,400px | 2K: 2560 × 1440 |
    | 2K+ | 36,86,401px to 82,94,400px+ | 2K+: 3840 × 2160 |
#### **10. I want to show 15 people on-screen but don’t want to use Full HD or 2K resolution to save my costs, how to do that?**
  - You can reduce the resolution of each video tile to (320 x 180), hence the aggregated resolution won’t cross HD (9,21,600px) & your cost will be saved.

          = 60 speaker-minutes used
            
      - Viewer minutes = 30 livestream minutes x 100 viewers
            
          = 3,000 viewers-minutes used
            
      - Considering $0.003/speaker-min & $0.0015/viewer-min (HD Resolution)
